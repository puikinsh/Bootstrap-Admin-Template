jQuery Countdown
================

This plugin sets a div or span to show a countdown to a given time.

* Standard or compact formats, or create your own layout.
* Decide which periods to show.
* Count up from a date/time instead.
* Cater for timezone differences and synchronise with server time.
* Over 50 localisations.

Have a look at the plugin Web site, http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html, for demonstrations of its abilities.

For documentation on the functionality see http://keith-wood.name/countdownRef.html.
